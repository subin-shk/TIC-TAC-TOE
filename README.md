<h1>✨ About This Project</h1>
<p>The game is played by two players. Staring from Player X, the player choose the cell to mark, followed by Player O who marks another cell accordingly.</p>
<p>The winning condition is met when either of the player matches 3 cells either row-wise, column-wise or diagonally with X or O's. When no matching is done and no cells are empty, then it is a draw.</p>

<h1>🤔 How Can It Be Improved?</h1>
<p>At the moment, the game can only be played by two players in same device. The project could be improved by adding a single-player feature where a player can play alone with the computer.</p>
