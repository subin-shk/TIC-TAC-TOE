<h1>✨ About this project</h1>
<p>The game is played by two players. Staring from Player X, the player choose the cell to mark, followed by Player O who marks another cell accordingly.</p>
<p>The winning condition is met when either of the player matches 3 cells either row-wise, column-wise or diagonally with X or O's. When no matching is done and no cells are empty, then it is a draw.</p>
